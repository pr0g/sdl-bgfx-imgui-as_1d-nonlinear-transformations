This repo is spawned from [sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter](https://github.com/pr0g/sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter) (please see the original repo for full details on project setup).

`sdl-bgfx-imgui-as_1d-nonlinear-transformations` is inspired by [Math for Game Programmers: Fast and Funky 1D Nonlinear Transformations](https://youtu.be/mr5xkf6zSzk). A talk by [Squirrel Eiserloh](https://twitter.com/SquirrelTweets).
